# Routing on Cisco ASA

<br>


# Cisco ASA Static Route Configuration

A static route on a Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) is used to manually specify the next-hop IP address for a specific destination network. This is especially useful when the ASA needs to reach networks that are not directly connected. Below are the steps and commands to configure a static route on a Cisco ASA.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you are in privileged EXEC mode on the ASA and have entered global configuration mode:

```bash
# Enter privileged EXEC mode
enable

# Enter global configuration mode
configure terminal
```

### Step 1: Identify the Destination Network and Next-Hop IP Address

Determine the destination network for which you want to configure the static route. Also, identify the next-hop IP address, which is the gateway that the ASA will use to reach the destination.

### Step 2: Configure the Static Route

Use the `route` command to configure a static route on the Cisco ASA:

```bash
# Configure a static route to reach the destination network via the next-hop IP address
route <interface_name> <destination_network> <subnet_mask> <next_hop_ip>
```

- `<interface_name>`: Specify the ASA interface through which the route should be directed (e.g., `outside`).
- `<destination_network>`: Specify the destination network's IP address or subnet.
- `<subnet_mask>`: Specify the subnet mask for the destination network.
- `<next_hop_ip>`: Specify the IP address of the next-hop router.

#### Example:

```bash
# Configure a static route to reach the 192.168.10.0/24 network via next-hop 10.0.0.1 on the outside interface
route outside 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1
```

### Step 3: Verify the Configuration

Verify the static route configuration using the `show route` command:

```bash
# Display the routing table to verify the static route
show route
```

Check the output for the configured static route entry and ensure that it appears as intended.

### Step 4: Save the Configuration

After verifying the static route, save the configuration to ensure that it persists across reboots:

```bash
# Save the configuration
write memory
```


You have successfully configured a static route on a Cisco ASA firewall. This static route will direct traffic destined for the specified network to the specified next-hop IP address.

# Cisco ASA Default Route Configuration

A default route on a Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) is used to specify the next-hop IP address for all traffic that does not match any specific static or dynamic routes in the routing table. This is often referred to as the "gateway of last resort." Below are the steps and commands to configure a default route on a Cisco ASA.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you are in privileged EXEC mode on the ASA and have entered global configuration mode:

```bash
# Enter privileged EXEC mode
enable

# Enter global configuration mode
configure terminal
```

### Step 1: Identify the Next-Hop IP Address

Determine the IP address of the next-hop router, which will serve as the default gateway for traffic that does not match any specific routes.

### Step 2: Configure the Default Route

Use the `route` command to configure a default route on the Cisco ASA:

```bash
# Configure a default route (gateway of last resort) via the next-hop IP address
route <interface_name> 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <next_hop_ip>
```

- `<interface_name>`: Specify the ASA interface through which the default route should be directed (e.g., `outside`).
- `<next_hop_ip>`: Specify the IP address of the next-hop router.

#### Example:

```bash
# Configure a default route via next-hop 203.0.113.1 on the outside interface
route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.1
```

### Step 3: Verify the Configuration

Verify the default route configuration using the `show route` command:

```bash
# Display the routing table to verify the default route
show route
```

Check the output for the configured default route entry, and ensure that it appears as intended.

### Step 4: Save the Configuration

After verifying the default route, save the configuration to ensure that it persists across reboots:

```bash
# Save the configuration
write memory
```

## Conclusion

You have successfully configured a default route (gateway of last resort) on a Cisco ASA firewall. This default route will direct traffic with no specific matching routes to the specified next-hop IP address.

# Cisco ASA EIGRP Configuration

EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is a dynamic routing protocol used to exchange routing information between routers. Configuring EIGRP on a Cisco ASA enables the firewall to participate in dynamic routing. Below are the steps and commands to configure EIGRP on a Cisco ASA.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you are in privileged EXEC mode on the ASA and have entered global configuration mode:

```bash
# Enter privileged EXEC mode
enable

# Enter global configuration mode
configure terminal
```

### Step 1: Enable EIGRP on the ASA

Enable EIGRP on the Cisco ASA and specify the autonomous system (AS) number:

```bash
# Enable EIGRP with AS number 1
router eigrp 1
```

### Step 2: Configure EIGRP Network Statements

Use the `network` command to specify the networks on which EIGRP should run. Include all directly connected networks:

```bash
# Specify the network and wildcard mask for connected interfaces
network <network_address> <wildcard_mask>
```

#### Example:

```bash
# Enable EIGRP on the 192.168.1.0/24 and 10.0.0.0/24 networks
router eigrp 1
  network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
  network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255
```

### Step 3: Adjust EIGRP Metrics (Optional)

You can adjust EIGRP metric parameters to influence route selection:

```bash
# Set the bandwidth and delay parameters on an interface
interface <interface_name>
  bandwidth <bandwidth_value>
  delay <delay_value>
```

#### Example:

```bash
# Set bandwidth and delay on interface GigabitEthernet0/1
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
  bandwidth 10000
  delay 1000
```

### Step 4: Verify EIGRP Configuration

Check the EIGRP configuration and see the routing table:

```bash
# Display EIGRP configuration and neighbors
show ip eigrp neighbors

# Display the routing table
show ip route eigrp
```

Ensure that EIGRP neighbors are formed, and routes are learned and installed in the routing table.

### Step 5: Save the Configuration

After verifying the EIGRP configuration, save the configuration to ensure it persists across reboots:

```bash
# Save the configuration
write memory
```

You have successfully configured EIGRP on a Cisco ASA firewall. The ASA will now participate in EIGRP routing, exchanging routing information with other routers in the network.

# Cisco ASA OSPF Configuration

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a dynamic routing protocol used to exchange routing information between routers. Configuring OSPF on a Cisco ASA allows the firewall to participate in dynamic routing. Below are the steps and commands to configure OSPF on a Cisco ASA.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you are in privileged EXEC mode on the ASA and have entered global configuration mode:

```bash
# Enter privileged EXEC mode
enable

# Enter global configuration mode
configure terminal
```

### Step 1: Enable OSPF on the ASA

Enable OSPF on the Cisco ASA and specify the OSPF process ID:

```bash
# Enable OSPF with process ID 1
router ospf 1
```

### Step 2: Configure OSPF Network Statements

Use the `network` command to specify the networks on which OSPF should run. Include all directly connected networks:

```bash
# Specify the network and wildcard mask for connected interfaces
network <network_address> <wildcard_mask> area <area_id>
```

#### Example:

```bash
# Enable OSPF on the 192.168.1.0/24 and 10.0.0.0/24 networks in OSPF area 0
router ospf 1
  network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
  network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
```

### Step 3: Adjust OSPF Metrics (Optional)

You can adjust OSPF metric parameters to influence route selection:

```bash
# Set the cost parameter on an interface
interface <interface_name>
  ip ospf cost <cost_value>
```

#### Example:

```bash
# Set OSPF cost on interface GigabitEthernet0/1
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
  ip ospf cost 10
```

### Step 4: Verify OSPF Configuration

Check the OSPF configuration and see the routing table:

```bash
# Display OSPF configuration and neighbors
show ip ospf neighbors

# Display OSPF routing information
show ip route ospf
```

Ensure that OSPF neighbors are formed, and routes are learned and installed in the routing table.

### Step 5: Save the Configuration

After verifying the OSPF configuration, save the configuration to ensure it persists across reboots:

```bash
# Save the configuration
write memory
```


You have successfully configured OSPF on a Cisco ASA firewall. The ASA will now participate in OSPF routing, exchanging routing information with other routers in the network.

# Cisco ASA VLANs and Trunking Configuration

VLANs (Virtual LANs) and trunking are used to segment and interconnect networks within a Cisco ASA firewall. Below are the steps and commands to configure VLANs and trunking on a Cisco ASA.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you are in privileged EXEC mode on the ASA and have entered global configuration mode:

```bash
# Enter privileged EXEC mode
enable

# Enter global configuration mode
configure terminal
```

### Step 1: Create VLANs

Use the `vlan` command to create VLANs on the Cisco ASA:

```bash
# Create VLAN 10 named "Sales"
vlan 10
  name Sales
  exit
```

Repeat this process for each VLAN you want to create.

### Step 2: Configure Trunk Ports

Use the `interface` command to configure trunk ports on the Cisco ASA:

```bash
# Configure interface GigabitEthernet0/2 as a trunk port
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
  switchport mode trunk
  switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
  exit
```

This example configures GigabitEthernet0/2 as a trunk port allowing VLANs 10 and 20. Repeat this process for each interface you want to configure as a trunk.

### Step 3: Verify VLAN and Trunking Configuration

Check the VLAN and trunking configuration using the `show vlan` and `show interfaces trunk` commands:

```bash
# Display VLAN configuration
show vlan

# Display trunking information on all interfaces
show interfaces trunk
```

Verify that the VLANs have been created and the trunk ports are configured correctly.

### Step 4: Save the Configuration

After verifying the VLAN and trunking configuration, save the configuration to ensure it persists across reboots:

```bash
# Save the configuration
write memory
```



You have successfully configured VLANs and trunking on a Cisco ASA firewall. The ASA will now be able to segment traffic into different VLANs and trunk VLAN information across designated interfaces.

# Cisco ASA Sub-Interfaces Configuration

Sub-interfaces on a Cisco ASA are used to divide a physical interface into multiple logical interfaces, allowing the ASA to participate in VLAN-based networking. Below are the steps and commands to configure sub-interfaces on a Cisco ASA.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you are in privileged EXEC mode on the ASA and have entered global configuration mode:

```bash
# Enter privileged EXEC mode
enable

# Enter global configuration mode
configure terminal
```

### Step 1: Create Sub-Interfaces

Use the `interface` command to create sub-interfaces on the Cisco ASA:

```bash
# Create sub-interfaces on GigabitEthernet0/3.1 and GigabitEthernet0/3.2
interface GigabitEthernet0/3.1
  encapsulation dot1Q 10
  ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
  exit

interface GigabitEthernet0/3.2
  encapsulation dot1Q 20
  ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
  exit
```

This example creates two sub-interfaces on GigabitEthernet0/3, one for VLAN 10 and another for VLAN 20. The `encapsulation dot1Q` command specifies the VLAN ID for each sub-interface.

### Step 2: Verify Sub-Interfaces Configuration

Check the sub-interfaces configuration using the `show interfaces` command:

```bash
# Display information about all interfaces
show interfaces
```

Verify that the sub-interfaces have been created and are in the desired VLANs.

### Step 3: Save the Configuration

After verifying the sub-interfaces configuration, save the configuration to ensure it persists across reboots:

```bash
# Save the configuration
write memory
```

You have successfully configured sub-interfaces on a Cisco ASA firewall. The ASA will now be able to handle traffic on multiple VLANs using the specified sub-interfaces.
