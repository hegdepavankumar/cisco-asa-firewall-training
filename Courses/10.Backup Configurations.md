# Cisco ASA Backup Configurations (TFTP)

Backing up configurations on Cisco ASA firewalls is crucial for ensuring data integrity and facilitating disaster recovery. TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is commonly used to perform configuration backups as it provides a simple method for transferring files between devices. Below, we'll discuss how to backup configurations from the ASA to a TFTP server and restore configurations from a TFTP server to the ASA.

## Backup Configuration to TFTP Server

### Steps:
1. **Configure TFTP Server**: Set up a TFTP server on a host machine connected to the same network as the ASA firewall.
2. **Enable TFTP on ASA**: Enable TFTP server access on the ASA firewall.
3. **Backup Configuration**: Initiate the backup process from the ASA to the TFTP server.

### Commands:
```bash
asa# copy running-config tftp:
Address or name of remote host []? <TFTP_SERVER_IP>
Destination filename [running-config]? <FILENAME>
```

## Restore Configuration from TFTP Server

### Steps:
1. **Verify TFTP Connectivity**: Ensure the ASA can reach the TFTP server and access the backup file.
2. **Copy Configuration**: Copy the configuration from the TFTP server to the ASA firewall.
3. **Apply Configuration**: Apply the restored configuration to the running configuration.

### Commands:
```bash
asa# copy tftp: running-config
Address or name of remote host []? <TFTP_SERVER_IP>
Source filename []? <FILENAME>
Destination filename [running-config]? 
```

## Example

### Backup Configuration to TFTP Server:
```bash
asa# copy running-config tftp:
Address or name of remote host []? 192.168.1.100
Destination filename [running-config]? backup-config
```

### Restore Configuration from TFTP Server:
```bash
asa# copy tftp: running-config
Address or name of remote host []? 192.168.1.100
Source filename []? backup-config
Destination filename [running-config]? 
```

Using TFTP for configuration backups on Cisco ASA firewalls provides a reliable and efficient method for safeguarding critical network configurations. By regularly backing up configurations and storing them on a TFTP server, administrators can ensure rapid recovery in the event of configuration errors or hardware failures.
